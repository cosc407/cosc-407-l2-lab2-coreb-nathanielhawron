/* Lab 2, core B -- THE ALTERNATIVE named in BRIEF.md.
 *
 * The two-turnstile barrier, out of counting semaphores: arrive, count, and
 * when the last one arrives open the first turnstile for everybody; then
 * leave, count down, and when the last one leaves open the second.
 * (Downey, "The Little Book of Semaphores", 3.6-3.7, and class 6.)
 *
 * TWO turnstiles, not one. Work out for yourself what a fast thread does to a
 * single-turnstile version before you decide the second one is decoration --
 * and say so in S2.3, because it is the same lesson as your fix.
 *
 * my_sem_init / my_sem_wait / my_sem_post / my_sem_destroy are declared in
 * include/mysem.h and implemented, correctly, in src/mysem_ref.c. A
 * pthread_mutex_t is fine for the counter.
 *
 * It is correct, and it is not expected to be fast. Do not tune it: it is
 * evidence, not a submission.
