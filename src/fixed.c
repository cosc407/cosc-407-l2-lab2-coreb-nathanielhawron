/* Lab 2, core B -- YOUR MINIMAL CORRECTION.

 * wait_() must work every time it is called, at 1, 2, 4 and 8 threads, and at
 * more threads than this machine has cores. It is already correct at two, and
 * that tells you nothing.
 *
 * Your fix here is very small. That is not a reason to write less in S2.3:
 * "minimal" has to be argued, and the argument is the invariant -- state it,
 * then show your version keeps it for every thread and not just for one.
 *
 * Copy anything you like out of given.c. Do not edit it.
